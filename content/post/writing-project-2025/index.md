I'm going to write it down here, because I want to have some measure of accountability, so here goes: I am going to take on a writing project this year, and it's going to be documenting my work looking at the file formats of [*The Summoning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Summoning_(video_game)).

I've started it, and gotten a little ways in, and I haven't decided yet how long it's going to be.
But right now, I'm hoping to tackle each file, and say a little bit about how I figured different things out as well as what they mean.

This is not going to take the place of *finishing* other projects, but is going to be a hobby that I want to go to when I have some spare time.  In 2023 I tried doing the "#dungeon23" challenge, and made it a few months.  I hope I this one closer to the end.

I'll probably end up checking it in to [dispersing](https://github.com/matthewturk/dispersing/) as documentation, eventually, and I might turn it into [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) but for now I'm writing it up in Obsidian using [Longform](https://github.com/kevboh/longform).
